<p><b>eSLIME</b> is an upcoming modeling system from Princeton University, designed to make it easier to develop multi-paradigm lattice models and push them out to a computing cluster.</p>

<p>eSLIME is currently in a pre-alpha state of development: it is not yet ready for use of any kind. However, if you wish to explore the code base, you are happy to download a copy and modify it as you see fit.</p>

<h3> Why should I use eSLIME?</h3>

<p>There are many modeling systems, such as NetLogo, that could potentially meet your needs. eSLIME is designed to run many iterations of your model, very quickly, and often on many different computers. This allows you to make quantitative, rather than descriptive, assessments of your system's behavior. This may be particularly useful for ecologists and biophysicists.</p>

<h3> What sorts of models can I develop in eSLIME?</h3>

<p>eSLIME models can feature individual-based rules ("bottom-up" modeling) and top-down perturbations, such as population rearrangements or system-wide update rules. Models take place on one or more coupled lattices. Positions in the lattice can either have one of a finite number of discrete states or a continuum of states. Most lattice models can therefore be implemented in eSLIME.</p>

<h3>What does "eSLIME" stand for?</h3>

<p>eSLIME stands for "extensible Lattice Iteration Modeling Engine.‚Äù</p>

<h3>Who can use or modify eSLIME?</h3>

<p>eSLIME is offered with a CC-BY International 4.0 license. Anyone can download and modify eSLIME, for any purpose, as long as they provide proper attribution.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>
<p>eSLIME is developed and maintained by David Bruce Borenstein (@biologicaldynamics), as part of his Ph.D. work with Professor Ned S. Wingreen at Princeton University.</p>
